		<p>	In recent news, a spotlight has been placed on the wealth disparity between England’s top soccer league (the Premier League) and other leagues throughout the globe. The Premier League reported TV revenue of more than 3.1 billion dollars in the 2021-22 season, while La Liga, which generated the second most in the world, earned less than half the TV revenue. </p>

		<p>Questions have swirled in the wake of this finding. Is the quality of the Premier League so high that its watchability is double the value of the next biggest league? Using statistics and numbers from advanced soccer statistics measurement website,<a href="https://fbref.com/en/" title="_blank">Football Reference (FBRef)</a> helps take a deeper dive to look at the discrepancy in quality between leagues. This study covered England’s Premier League, Spain’s La Liga, Germany’s Bundesliga, Italy’s Serie A, and France’s Ligue 1. Because the numbers of focus relate to TV revenue, it is essential to determine what stats prove what league is watchable and exciting. </p>

			<h3>Explaining the Data</h3>

			</div>
		</div>

		<p>	Frequency of <b>penalty kicks</b> and <b>fouls conceded</b> are both significant metrics as they indicate a lack of quality in defending and a higher likelihood of making rash fouls. <p>

		<p>Francesco Riverso, Program Manager for Sports Analytics and head of the Soccer Data Analytics Club at Syracuse University, has a lengthy soccer fan and data analyst background. In sports analytics, Riverso does intensive work on analyzing different metrics and their effect on the game. He describes a personal experience that shows the danger of conceding fouls and why they are such an important metric to track.</p>

		<p>"Giving away dumb fouls and penalty kicks can be a criminal offense. Don't give away free kicks anywhere near the box when you are playing Southampton; for example, someone like James Ward-Prowse can get on the ball. My favorite team lost this year to them because they gave him one free-kick chance, and he buried it, top corner."</p>

		<p><b>Shots taken </b> and <b>expected goals</b> are two other vital stats that indicate watchability in that there are more exciting goal-scoring opportunities. <a href="https://statsbomb.com/soccer-metrics/expected-goals-xg-explained/#:~:text=Put%20simply%2C%20Expected%20Goals%20(xG,scale%20between%200%20and%201." title="_blank">Advanced models</a> calculate <b>expected</b> goals to measure the probability of a shot resulting in a goal. The models use historical information of thousands of shots with similar characteristics (like shot location) to estimate the likelihood of a goal on a scale from 0 to 1. </p>
	
		<p>Riverso agrees that these metrics are critical to understanding how many quality chances are created each game, "The advanced data is too good to ignore. A really good expected goals model can predict outcomes over 80% of the time." </p>

		<p><b>Touches in the opponent's penalty box </b> are also a vital stat representing how often teams find themselves in dangerous attacking areas, making games more exciting. Finally, <b>players successfully beaten on the dribble</b> is an important metric as excellent dribbling is widely considered one of the game's most appealing and eye-catching aspects. </p>

		<p>Kelly Madsen, an assistant coach in the Syracuse Women's soccer program, has recently been tracking more data to improve her athletes' output. She concurs with the notion that <b>touches in the opponent's penalty area</b> is one stat that is particularly indicative of success. </p>

		<p>"I think having a good methodology for how you want to create chances helps direct your play. We look at Man(chester) City, for example, and they always score the same type of goals. They get the ball and hold it in dangerous areas in and around the box. We look to possess in our opponent's box as well." </p>

			<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>After looking through the qualities of each of the leagues, the data analysis <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17g8iCMRJDB4wpBCMb00g1s2Jh2ISjd8F/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106610731587715077711&rtpof=true&sd=true" title="_blank">(final data analysis here)</a> from FBRef shows that the English Premier League measures as the league of highest watchability through per-match statistics. FBRef statistics indicate that the Premier League has the highest defensive quality. Players in the league <b>commit rash fouls</b> and <b>force penalty kicks</b> at significantly lower rates than in the other leagues. This stat comes despite Premier League teams ranking first for <b>touches in the attacking 18-yard box</b>, meaning that defenders are put in challenging situations most frequently but make the correct play more regularly. The Premier League also ranks top three in the other measured categories of <b>shots, expected goals, and successful dribbles,</b> indicating a balance between high-quality attacking and quality defending. </p>

		<p>The Premier League findings from the dataset indicate more balance in the league's play when compared to the high-tempo and electric attacking style of the Bundesliga or Ligue 1. The league also does not measure as dull and slow as the Serie A or La Liga.</p>
		
		<div> <img width="90%" src="Table.png" alt="Findings Table">

		<div class="captions">The final standings for each major metric by league including averages and final standings. Metrics shown are defenders successfully beaten by a dribble (Succ), expected goals (xG), shots (Sh), touches in opponents penalty area (Att Pen), penalties conceded (PKcon), and fouls committed (Fls). 
			</div>

		<p>Ligue 1, for example, according to the sampled FBRef data, has the highest frequency of <b>successful dribbles</b> by more than two per game. It also ranks second in <b>expected goals</b> despite being fourth in <b>shot frequency.</b> It is also first in <b>penalty kicks conceded per game.</b> These statistics paint the picture of a league with a fast and uptempo playing style. However, the data tells us French defenses are conceding many <b>expected goals</b> despite only a few <b>shots registered</b> and also <b>conceding many penalties,</b> indicating lower defensive standards. This analysis shows that although Ligue 1 can provide high-octane attacking play, you are likelier to see defensive lapses and errors. </p>

		<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, La Liga, recently ridiculed for slow and conservative play, ranks last in <b>touches in opponent's penalty areas</b>, last in <b>shots</b>, and second last in <b>expected goals</b> according to the FBRef data. These numbers give credence to the notion that significantly less exciting attacking moments occur in La Liga games. On top of this, the games become even slower as La Liga teams <b>commit fouls</b> most frequently. This style makes the game slow, dull, defensive, and less watchable.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<div class="images"> <img src="Enzo.jpeg" alt="Enzo Ferdnandez Unveiling">

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>In these conclusions, it is essential to consider that the full breadth of these metrics has not been covered. FBRef gives access to hundreds of different stats from many leagues and thousands of clubs. Analyzing all of them would have been impossible; therefore, narrowing it down to six key categories to measure watchability was necessary.</p>

		<p>Choosing these stats alone is a limitation as there is no standard measurement for 'watchability.' The outcome could have been vastly different if a separate set of metrics were used. Finally, these stats only represent this season through April 11th, which only paints part of the picture of these leagues throughout history. </p>

		<p>In recent years, the discrepancy in the Premier League's wealth compared to others has been made very apparent. 24 of the 50 priciest transfers ever have gone to England in the last 15 years. Additionally, according to the Deloitte Money League, 11 of the 20 wealthiest clubs in the world play in the Premier League. These numbers indicate that Premier League clubs are becoming far removed from others regarding wealth, mainly due to their massive TV revenue streams.</p>

		<p>Through the analysis of FBRefs numbers above, one can see that the Premier League hosts the most balanced and watchable product. High-quality attacking play and quality defending in a league that hosts a massive share of the most elite players in the world. So, is it justifiable to see them generate double the TV revenue of any other league worldwide? Although the numbers indicate that the Premier League is better, it may not double the value of other elite leagues. </p>

		<p>As this issue develops, it becomes apparent that it is quite cyclical and will continue to provide issues for club football worldwide. The Premier League earns vastly more than any other league allowing it to monopolize the market for the best players. These elite players make the league more marketable and watchable, generating even more TV revenue for the league, which goes back to the teams. Could the Premier League eventually monopolize the market more than they have today? </p>
